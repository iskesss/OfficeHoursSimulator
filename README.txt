This program is intended to model a college CS professor's office hour sessions over the course of an academic term. The default number of simulated sessions per execution is 10 (chosen arbitrarily). This can easily be changed within 'main.cpp', but do note that one new text file will be created for every simulated session, so I wouldn't advise setting the number of simulated sessions to any extreme number (unless you REALLY want to flood your directory with text files).

A summary of session statistics will be printed to the console after the simulation has concluded. Also, a record of students and the academic topics that each asked about will be saved to a local text file called 'recent_SSaTT'. You'll be able to search through or sort this data via the console immediately after the simulation concludes.

Make sure to compile in C++11.

Thanks for trying my code!
